# MOWITO SUBMISSION
  I have written a simple RRT algorithm.
  For running the above script you need to first copy or clone it to your sytstem and give it permission to get executed.
  
  This algorithm takes into account various circles as obstacles (you can change the centers of the circles to change the obstacles).

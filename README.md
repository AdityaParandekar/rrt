# MOWITO SUBMISSION
  I have written a simple RRT algorithm.
  
  For running the above script you need to first copy or clone it to your sytstem and give it permission to get executed.
  
  This algorithm takes into account various circles as obstacles (you can change the centers of the circles to change the obstacles).
  For this you need to change the obstaclex and obstacley arrays in the rrt.py file.

  The user needs to input the x and y goal points and a path is plotted using matplotlib.
  The final path is also printed on the terminal from starting position to the goal point avoiding all the obstacles.

here the goal was (10,10)

  Thanks a lot for your valuable time!!
